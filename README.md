Authors of the PHREEQC code: David L. Parkhurst and C.A.J. Appelo

Description & Use:
PHREEQC is one of the major nowadays geochemical programs used for aqueous speciation modelling. For more information about the program and its usage in geochemistry and chemistry, please visit the project homepage, read the attached original manuals or check our attempts (Mobile Chemistry Portal).
